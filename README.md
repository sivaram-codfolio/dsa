[1 3 0]
[4 3 2 2]
[1 0]
```

🏗 **Add Binary**

📜 *Sample Output*

```bash
100
10101
0
1000
```

🏗 **Sqrt(x)**

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

📌 *Example Execution*

```bash
go run cmd/median_of_two_sorted_array.go
```

📜 *Sample Output*

```bash
Median: 2
Median: 2.5
```

🏗 **Reverse Integer**

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

📌 *Example Execution*

```bash
go run cmd/reverse_integer.go
```

📜 *Sample Output*

```bash
321
-321
21
0
```

🏗 **3Sum**

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

📌 *Example Execution*

```bash
go run cmd/3sum.go
```

📜 *Sample Output*

```bash
[[-1 -1 2] [-1 0 1]]
[]
[[0 0 0]]
```

🏗 **Container With Most Water**

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

📌 *Example Execution*

```bash
go run cmd/container_with_most_water.go
```

📜 *Sample Output*

```bash
49
1
```

🏗 **String to Integer (atoi)**

Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither present.
Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.
Return the integer as the final result.

📌 *Example Execution*

```bash
go run cmd/string_to_integer.go
```

📜 *Sample Output*

```bash
42
-42
4193
0
-2147483648
```

🏗 **Integer to Roman**

Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:

If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.
If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).
Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.
Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.

📌 *Example Execution*

```bash
go run cmd/integer_to_roman.go
```

📜 *Sample Output*

```bash
III
LVIII
MCMXCIV
```

🏗 **Generate Parentheses**

Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

📌 *Example Execution*

```bash
go run cmd/generate_parentheses.go
```

📜 *Sample Output*

```bash
[((())) (()()) (())() ()(()) ()()()]
[()]
```

🏗 **Letter Combinations of a Phone Number**

Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.

A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

📌 *Example Execution*

```bash
go run cmd/letter_combination_of_phone_number.go
```

📜 *Sample Output*

```bash
[ad ae af bd be bf cd ce cf]
[]
[a b c]
```

🏗 **Divide Two Integers**

Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, 8.345 would be truncated to 8, and -2.7335 would be truncated to -2.

Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.

Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231, 231 − 1]. For this problem, if the quotient is strictly greater than 231 - 1, then return 231 - 1, and if the quotient is strictly less than -231, then return -231.

📌 *Example Execution*

```bash
go run cmd/divide_two_integers.go
```

📜 *Sample Output*

```bash
3
-2
0
1
2147483647
```

🏗 **Majority Element**

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

📌 *Example Execution*

```bash
go run cmd/majority_element.go
```

📜 *Sample Output*

```bash
3
2
```

🏗 **Valid Sudoku**

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

📌 *Example Execution*

```bash
go run cmd/valid_sudoku.go 
```

📜 *Sample Output*

```bash
true
```


🏗 **Intersection of Two Linked Lists**

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

📌 *Example Execution*

```bash
go run cmd/intersection_of_two_linked_lists.go
```

📜 *Sample Output*

```bash
List A:
4 -> 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 5 -> nil
List B:
5 -> 6 -> 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 5 -> nil
Intersection at node with value: 8
```
