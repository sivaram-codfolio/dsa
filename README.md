# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Go

A collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Go. This repository serves as a reference for developers looking to understand and apply DSA concepts effectively in Go projects.

🚀 *DSA Covered**

🏗 **Duplicate Sorted Array**

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

📌 *Example Execution*

```bash
go run cmd/duplicate_sorted_array.go
```

📜 *Sample Output*

```bash
Output: 2, nums1 = [1 2]
Output: 8, nums2 = [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7]
```


🏗 **Remove Element**

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

📌 *Example Execution*

```bash
go run cmd/remove_element.go
```

📜 *Sample Output*

```bash
Input: nums = [3 2 2 3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2 2]

Input: nums = [0 1 2 2 3 0 4 2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0 1 3 0 4]
```

🏗 **Search Insert Position**

The Search Insert Position problem is about finding the index at which a target value should be inserted into a sorted array, such that the array remains sorted.

📌 *Example Execution*

```bash
go run cmd/search_insert_position.go
```

📜 *Sample Output*

```bash
2
1
4
0
```

🏗 **Length of Last Word**

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

📌 *Example Execution*

```bash
go run cmd/length_last_word.go
```

📜 *Sample Output*

```bash
5
6
```
